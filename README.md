# Document Conversion Services

This project provides a simple LaTeX presentation slide to showcase my services for converting various types of documents into editable PDF format using LaTeX.

## Services Offered

I offer document conversion services for the following formats:

- **Microsoft Word** documents (.docx)
- **PowerPoint** presentations (.pptx)
- **Handwritten content** (scanned or photographed)
  
These documents will be converted into editable **LaTeX** format, which can then be used to generate high-quality PDFs.

## Features

- **Accuracy**: All text and equations are converted accurately.
- **Editable PDFs**: The converted documents are fully editable in LaTeX.
- **Custom Formatting**: The LaTeX output is properly formatted, ready for further editing or publishing.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodeTronixHub/latex-document-conversion.git
